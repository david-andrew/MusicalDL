basic test of the wavenet, using simple waveforms
waveforms include sine, triangle, square, saw, and noise
network conditions include pitch, amplitude, and wave-type

any checkpoints that end in #00 need to have the pitch condition rescaled between C4 and C5 as opposed to the current setup of scaling eventing between 0Hz and C9.
